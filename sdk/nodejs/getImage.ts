/**
 * Get information on an images for use in other resources (e.g. creating a Droplet
 * based on snapshot). This data source provides all of the image properties as
 * configured on your DigitalOcean account. This is useful if the image in question
 * is not managed by Terraform or you need to utilize any of the image's data.
 * 
 * An error is triggered if zero or more than one result is returned by the query.
 * 
 * ## Example Usage
 * 
 * Get the data about a snapshot:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as digitalocean from "@pulumi/digitalocean";
 * 
 * const example1 = pulumi.output(digitalocean.getImage({
 *     name: "example-1.0.0",
 * }));
 * ```
 * 
 * Reuse the data about a snapshot to create a Droplet:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as digitalocean from "@pulumi/digitalocean";
 * 
 * const example1Image = pulumi.output(digitalocean.getImage({
 *     name: "example-1.0.0",
 * }));
 * const example1Droplet = new digitalocean.Droplet("example1", {
 *     image: example1Image.apply(example1Image => example1Image.image),
 *     region: "nyc2",
 *     size: "s-1vcpu-1gb",
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * Get the data about an official image:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as digitalocean from "@pulumi/digitalocean";
 * 
 * const example2 = pulumi.output(digitalocean.getImage({
 *     slug: "ubuntu-18-04-x64",
 * }));
 * ```
